tyrant_optimize
===============
This fork tries to adapt the code to be used with Tyrant Unleashed!
This is not working at the moment

Version 0.1
===========
TU: cards.xml and mission.xml are now parsed
Mission decks will always refer to mission level 10
Card level has to be indicated -level
eg. Barracus-6 => Barracus Level 6
This is working at the moment
tyrant_optimize.exe "Barracus-6, Starformer-6, Tartarus Brood-6" "94. Heart of Tartarus" debug
What is still missing:
Poison is triggered at start instead of end of turn
Enhance Skill not working
Jam Skill not working as in TU
